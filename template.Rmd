## Section One (Allison with songs)

```{r student1}
##songs listed in word document 
```


## Section Two (Gracie with year and time/word length)

```{r student2}

```

## Section Three (Shakira with lyrics)

```{r student3}

## Section Four (Working together on function)

```{r student4}
#going to have to create lists like this (i got this from chatgpt)
#maybe we do a different list for each decade 
songs <- list(
  list(title = "Hello", lyrics = "Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet."),
  list(title = "Shake It Off", lyrics = "Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play. And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."),
  list(title = "Happy", lyrics = "Because I'm happy. Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof. Because I'm happy.")
)

#then write a function that can run through this list 


#possible function looking for titles
measure_title_repetition <- function(lyrics, title) {
  # Normalize text
  lyrics_clean <- tolower(gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", lyrics))
  title_clean <- tolower(gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", title))

  title_length <- length(title_words)
  if (length(words) < title_length) return(0)
  
  # Slide through lyrics to match title
  matches <- 0
  for (i in 1:(length(words) - title_length + 1)) {
    if (all(words[i:(i + title_length - 1)] == title_words)) {
      matches <- matches + 1
    }
  }
  
  # Return matches normalized by total number of phrases in lyrics
  return(matches / (length(words) - title_length + 1))

#how to get the results of how many songs repeat their title
results <- lapply(songs, function(song) {
