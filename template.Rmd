#maybe we do a different list for each decade

  list(title = "Happy", lyrics = "Because I'm happy. Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof. Because I'm happy.")

#then write a function that can run through this list 


#possible function looking for titles

  # Slide through lyrics to match title

  # Return matches normalized by total number of phrases in lyrics
